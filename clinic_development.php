            The goal of the Verséa Rx botanical clinical program is to gain IND approval with multiple product candidates.
            Following IND approval each botanical candidate will undergo pre-clinical toxicologic assessments followed by human trials where Verséa will seeking to
            be advance one of the first hemp-derived botanical extract-based drug product candidates at the FDA.

          <p>Verséa has partnered with educational providers to bring continuing medical education (CME) on the Endocannabinoid System.
            The program is produced by HAVAS and provides up to 12 PRA category 1 credits upon completion of the full program.
            There is a fee for this program. For more information about this certification program <a href="#">(click here).</a></p>

          <p>Verséa is evaluating new drug candidates (new chemical and botanical entities) and delivery approaches of ethical
            pharmaceuticals to address medical needs. Our medical hemp research is focused on
            studying components of the hemp plant individually and in combinations to assess in vitro and
            in vivo response across multiple body systems. Physiologic response determines the
            therapeutic target for each candidate. This process allows Verséa to build a pipeline of New
            Chemical Entities (NCEs) and Botanical Rx drug candidates. Areas of interest to Verséa for ethical
            drug, botanical drug, and product development are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pain</li>

          <p>The Verséa breeding program is designed to translate lab-created New Chemical Entities (NCEs) to
            botanical chemovars that are replicated and scaled for cultivation.
            Innovative techniques and processes will allow for the rapid scale up to produce botanical drug substances
            and novel drug products for clinical trials through the Rx Botanical program. During this discovery and
            development effort, Verséa may discover an NCE that warrants pharmaceutical
            development as a single agent (versus component of a botanical drug substance).</p>

          <p>Our clinical program is aimed at advancing NCE and Rx Botanical candidates towards global market
            approvals. The initial focus of Verséa is on the Rx Botanical clinical program. The near-term
            goal of this program is to submit Investigational New Drugs (INDs) for various hemp-derived Rx
            Botanical candidates. Verséa is positioned to a first mover in this market segment.</p>
