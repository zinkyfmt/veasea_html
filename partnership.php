              <p>Hospitals, practices and clinics are partnering with Verséa on the recruitment of patients into the Verséa Patient Registry,
                one of the first-of-its-kind launched in the United States. The registry is an IRB-approved HIPAA compliant registry collecting
                data to provide much-needed answers about how patients are using Verséa products. Aggregate data will be made available for analysis,
                publication and release into the public domain. To learn more about how to participate as a clinical site in the Verséa Patient Registry, <a href="mailto:Info@versea.com">click here</a></p>

              <p>Verséa is dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and science-related to cannabinoids and other components of the hemp plant.
                As such we have established partnerships with leading researchers to study the hemp plant, its components and how they interact with
                the systems in the human body.  Through this and other partnerships our research is driving the development of a proprietary drug-discovery platform that allows for the rapid screening and de-risking of clinical development assets coming out of the laboratory.
