              <p>Verséa is dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and science-related to cannabinoids and other components of the hemp plant.
                As such we have established partnerships with leading researchers to study the hemp plant, its components and how they interact with
                the systems in the human body.  Through this and other partnerships our research is driving the development of a proprietary drug-discovery platform that allows for the rapid screening and de-risking of clinical development assets coming out of the laboratory.
