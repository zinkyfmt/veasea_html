                      Sean has worked alongside major politicians and leading sustainability organizations around the world to develop strategies around fighting global hunger.
                      In the healthcare industry, Sean successfully crested, launched and oversaw a highly profitable set of print and digital publications, targeting oncology,
                      pain management and cardiology professionals. Most recently with PAINWeek, Sean developed new revenue streams that helped structure the business for an exit.</p>
                      <p>Within 3 years, PAINWeek sold to a public company traded on the London Stock Exchange.  From this experience within the analgesics and co-morbidities in pain space,
