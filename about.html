                  <p>Mr. Fetcho has been involved with early stage and start-up companies for the last 15 years. He has been a co-founder in multiple companies, including a
                    revolutionary packaging technology that sustains the life of produce and flowers while in transit all while killing off food-borne pathogens.
                    Sean has worked alongside major politicians and leading sustainability organizations around the world to develop strategies around fighting global hunger.
                    In the healthcare industry, Sean successfully created, launched and oversaw a highly profitable set of print and digital publications, targeting oncology,
                    pain management and cardiology professionals. Most recently with PAINWeek, Sean developed new revenue streams that helped structure the business for an exit.</p>
                  <p>Within 3 years, PAINWeek sold to a public company traded on the London Stock Exchange.  From this experience within the analgesics and co-morbidities in pain space,
                    he quickly realized the opioid epidemic is rapidly growing and that the world is seeking change. He believed Alternative Therapy treatments will be the future and farm
                    bill compliant hemp can be one of these groundbreaking solutions. Verséa was then conceptualized between the founders. Sean attended University of Westminster and Towson University
                    with degrees in Economics & Psychology. He participated in Columbia University's School of Business training programs for executives and advanced training in Neuro-Linguistic
